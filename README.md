## This challenge is no longer valid. I created this repository for the purpose of studying frontend technologies.

# FrontEnd Challenge

#### Congratulations if you received the link of this repository to begin the first part of your interview at NonDutch!

> We hate doing tests but they are useful to filter out the best candidates.

 :warning: **DO NOT OPEN A PULL REQUEST!** Delivering the test in a way that's not specified will lead to it being ignored.


 You need to build an application using any of the following technologies:
 
 - React;
 - React Native;
 - Angular (5);
 - VueJS;
 - Polymer (2).
 
 You will need to choose one of the items below (Star Wars **or** Cryptocurrency):
 
 1. A `Star Wars` app (no layout, be creative :D) and should do the following:
 
 - [ ] Consume [SWAPI] (Star Wars API);
 - [ ] List planets in the movies (`name` and `population`);
 - [ ] Open the details of a planet (`name`, `population`, `diameter`, `climate`, `gravity` and name of the `films`);
 - [ ] List the people in the movies with basic data (`name` and `height`);
 - [ ] Open the details of a person (`name`, `height`, `gender`, `birth_year`, `hair_color`, `skin_color`, `homeworld`, and name of the `films`);
    - [ ] Link the homeworld to "Planet detail" screen.
    
 2. A `Cryptocurrency Dashboard & Calculator` and should do the following:
 
 - [ ] Consume [CoinmarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) API;
 - [ ] Use the main layout in the [design folder](https://github.com/NonDutch/frontend-challenge/tree/master/design);
   - [ ] Use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) as main webfont;
 - [ ] List the top 12 currencies;
 - [ ] Show the current price in Euro;
 - [ ] Show the variation of the price by day;
 - [ ] Create a calculator with a base value in Euro or Cryptocurrencies that will be converted to 2 other values;
 - [ ] You can't select the same currencies in the calculator.

 **You must choose only one project for the test.**
 
 To provide the code you must **fork** this repository (**which must remain as private**), do your changes and send an email back with the link to it stating that you finished the test.
  
 ## I don't have time to do a test
 
 It's understandable if you don't have time to do the test, it's purpose is to know your level of knowledge in a specific library/framework.
 
 If you choose to not submit the test you can simply email back the person that sent you this repository stating that you won't do the test and we will review your knowledge based on your public online profile.
